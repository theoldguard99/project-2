            Instructions
        </p><br>
        <p class="instructions">
            (1) The main objective of the game is to put more beans into each players scores located at the top
            and bottom of the table. 
            <br>
            (2) Players takes turns to pick one of the six small pots on their side. The beans are taken from 
            the chosen pot and dropped one by one into the other pots, proceeding in a counter-clockwise movement around the board.
            <br>
            That includes dropping into their own big pot - the one on the right - and the opponent's small pots. 
            However, you never drop a bean into the opponent's big pot.
            <br>
            (3) This continues until all the beans picked up have been dropped off again. One of three things then happens:
        </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You drop the last bean into your own big pot. You now earn another turn. You can have as many turns as you like 
                    in this way, while you continue to finish in the big pot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You drop the last bean into a small pot that was previously empty. This is the real meat of the game. Not only does this final bean go straight into your big pot, but also all beans from the opposite small pot of your opponent. This is stealing and it's usually the stolen beans that decide the outcome 
                    of the game. The strategical implications of this rule are enormous.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You finish anywhere else. Play switches to your opponent.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <p class="instructions">(4) Play continues until one player has only empty pots. Then the other player empties any beans left in his own small pots into his big pot, and player's totals are counted up.</p>
